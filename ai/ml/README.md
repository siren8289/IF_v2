# ML experiments (PROPOSED — not in MVP serving path)

Authoritative production score is **rule + statistics** (`rule_stat_v1`).
See [`docs/ML.md`](../../docs/ML.md).

This directory is reserved for future:

- labeled evaluation datasets (no leakage)
- offline experiments (linear/logistic/tree)
- comparison reports vs `rule_stat_v1`
- model registry metadata **after** approval gate

Do **not** wire models here into `/score` until ML.md acceptance criteria are met.
Deep learning: **NOT APPLICABLE** for current IF scope.
